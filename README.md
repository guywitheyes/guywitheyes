# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Hassan, a programmer. I have extensive knowledge and experience working in Python, especially web frameworks such as Django and Flask. I'm also very good at Javascript. I enjoy coding and learning new things. I currently live in Pakistan.

I'm currently just exploring things that I like.

## What I'm working on:
- **Python:** I'm pretty great at Python, but there's always more to learn.
- **Javascript:** There are a couple advanced topics that need some work.  

## Technologies I know:
* **HTML/CSS/JS**: Eazy.
* **Python**: This was actually the first language I learned.
* **Flask/Django**: I'm good at both frameworks. Whether you use Flask or Django, I can work with you.


I've always found that projects are the best way to learn. Applying what you've learned and building something useful with it is the best way to learn. If you have a project you'd like me on, you can reach me at:
