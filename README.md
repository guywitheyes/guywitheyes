# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Hassan, a coder who has experience coding in Python and currently learning JavaScript. I enjoy coding and learning new things.

I'm currently just exploring things that I like.

## What I'm working on:
- **Python:** I have experience with Python, but I'm by no means an expert in it. 
- **Javascript:** Just started. This will probably take a while.
- **CSS3:** Too many people have claimed that CSS is easy... It is not easy.

I've always found that projects are the best way to learn. Applying what you've learned and building something useful with it is the best way to learn. If you have a project you'd like me on, you can reach me at:
